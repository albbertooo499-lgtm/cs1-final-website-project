        <h1>JACK THE RIPPER: THE BIG QUESTION</h1>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>Jack the ripper</strong> (Jack the Ripper) It's the nickname given to the serial killer <strong> not identificated</strong> who terrorized the Whitechapel district of London in late 1888. His identity remains one of the most famous and unsolved criminal enigmas in history..</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>the person behind the name</H2>

    <ul>
        <LI><strong>nickname:</strong> The name "Jack the Ripper" was not a police name, but was popularized through the press, after a letter (possibly fake) arrived at a news agency signed with that name..
        <LI><strong>Attributed Skills:</strong> The nature of the mutilations on his canonical victims (the five women officially attributed to him) suggested that the killer possessed some anatomical or surgical knowledge.
        <LI><strong>who was supposed to be:</strong>Researchers at the time suggested that he might have been a man who could blend in easily, perhaps with a profession that gave him access to sharp instruments and knowledge of the human body (doctor, butcher, etc.). ).
        </ul>

    <h2>suspects according to their identity</h2>

    <P>suspects according to their identity:</P>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Aaron Kosminski:</strong> A Polish barber who lived in Whitechapel. He was a key suspect for contemporary police and in recent decades has been the subject of controversial DNA analysis pointing to him.
        <li><strong>Montague John Druitt:</strong> An upper-class lawyer whose name surfaced in late police reports. His suicide in December 1888 coincided with the cessation of crimes, making him a strong suspect.
        <li><strong>Francis Tumblety:</strong> An American "pseudo-doctor" with a deep hatred of women. He fled the country in November 1888. He was considered a prime suspect by the chief inspector of the time.
    </ulL>

    <h2>THE TERROR FINAL</h2>

    <p>The murders stopped as abruptly as they began after November 1888. Theories about this cessation include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the ripper <strong>died</strong> (as was possibly the case with Druitt).
        <li>was <strong>imprisoned</strong> for a minor offense (as was possibly the case with Kosminski, who was placed in an asylum).
        <li><strong>him ran away</strong> from London or the country (like Tumblety).
        </ul>
